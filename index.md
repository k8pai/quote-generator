HTML is the most widely used language to write web pages. Every web page is actually an HTML file. Each HTML file is a plain text that defines a set of commands for creating hypertext documents. These commands are known as HTML tags. While using these tags, some keywords may be attached to them, which make the instruction more specific. These words are known as attributes. Therefore, an HTML document is made up of tags and attributes which work together to decide how the contents of the web page have to be displayed on the browser.
